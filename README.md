**CLI Game Manager for AI-Generated Games**

*The most irresponsibly coded package manager you'll ever love* 🤖✨

A versatile package manager and runtime launcher for command-line games written by AI in various programming languages. Think of it as `npm` or `pip`, but for CLI games across multiple languages—except everything here was conjured by an LLM having a good day.

> **🎨 VIBE CODED:** This entire tool—from the package manager to this very README—was generated by Claude in a single conversation. It's AI code managing AI games for AI game developers. It's vibes all the way down. If you're not vibing with AI-generated code, this might not be your scene. But if you are? Welcome home. 🏠

> **🤖 By AI, For AI:** Both this tool and the games it runs are AI-generated. This is a celebration of what LLMs can create when given the right prompts and a lot of enthusiasm. Bugs? Features. Unexpected behavior? The spice of life. We're all just vibing here. ✨

## 💬 Community Discord

**Discord Server:** https://discord.gg/8NaXEaxWR4

A place to share AI-generated games. Think of it as a very irresponsible repository where games are shared directly. Drop your games, try others' games. That's it.

⚠️ **Extra caution advised** - Games shared are completely unvetted. Always review code thoroughly before installing.

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNING

**THIS TOOL EXECUTES ARBITRARY CODE FROM THIRD-PARTY SOURCES**

🚨 **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED: Run in a containerized environment**

```bash
# Example: Run in Docker with isolated home directory
docker run -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/clvibe-home:/home/user/.clvibe \
  -v $(pwd)/games:/games:ro \
  python:3.11 bash

# Inside container, install and use clvibe safely
```

**Why containerization is strongly suggested:**
- AI-generated games may contain bugs or unintended behavior
- Third-party code could access your file system
- Games have full access to your home directory by default
- Isolation limits potential damage from malicious or buggy code

**If you choose to run on your host system:**
- Create a separate user account with limited privileges
- Use a dedicated home directory: `HOME=/tmp/clvibe-home clvibe play game`
- Review all code before execution
- Never run as root/administrator
- Keep important data backed up

**The choice is yours, but we strongly encourage containerization for safety.**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clvibe.git
   cd clvibe
   ```

2. **Run the installer:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   clvibe check
   ```

**If `clvibe` command is not found after installation:**

The installer automatically adds `~/.local/bin` to your PATH, but you may need to reload your shell or manually add it:

```bash
# For bash
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# For zsh
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# For fish
fish_add_path ~/.local/bin

# Or restart your terminal
```

### First Steps

```bash
# Check available language runtimes
clvibe check

# Install a game from a directory
clvibe install ./my-game/

# Install from a zip file
clvibe install ./my-game.zip

# Install from a URL
clvibe install https://example.com/game.zip

# List installed games
clvibe list

# Play a game (by name or number)
clvibe play "Semantic Labyrinth"
clvibe play 1
```

---

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Installing Games

**The `install` command automatically detects what you're installing:**

```bash
# Single game from directory
clvibe install ./my-game/

# Single game from zip
clvibe install ./my-game.zip

# Single game from URL
clvibe install https://example.com/game.zip

# Collection from directory (auto-detected: multiple game.json files)
clvibe install ./my-games-folder/

# Collection from zip (auto-detected)
clvibe install ./game-collection.zip

# Collection from URL (auto-detected)
clvibe install https://example.com/collection.zip

# Force as collection (install all games found, even if just one)
clvibe install ./games/ --collection
clvibe install ./games.zip -c
```

**Automatic detection:**
- If source contains 1 game.json → installs as single game
- If source contains 2+ game.json files → installs as collection
- Works with directories, zips, and URLs
- Use `--collection` or `-c` flag to force collection mode

### Vibifying a Game (Creating game.json)

**Don't have a game.json yet? No problem!**

```bash
clvibe vibify ./my-game-directory/
```

The vibify command will:
- 🔍 Auto-detect the programming language
- 📝 Show you all script files and let you pick the main one
- ✨ Ask for game metadata (name, author, LLM used, version)
- 💾 Generate and save game.json
- 🎮 Offer to install the game immediately

**Example vibify session:**
```bash
$ clvibe vibify ./awesome-rpg/

✨ Let's vibify this game! ✨

- Version, author, and LLM always displayed

**Play a game:**
```bash
clvibe play "Game Name"    # By name
clvibe play 1              # By index
```

**Uninstall:**
```bash
clvibe uninstall "Game Name"
clvibe uninstall 1
# Optionally keep zip backup when prompted
```

**Find duplicates:**
```bash
clvibe dedupe
# Scans for games with identical game.json
# Keeps first instance, removes duplicates
```

### Backup & Restore

**List backups:**
```bash
clvibe list-zipped
```

**Restore from backup:**
```bash
clvibe restore "Game Name"
clvibe restore 1
```

**Sync backups:**
```bash
clvibe sync    # Create missing backups, remove orphaned ones
```

**Find and remove duplicates:**
```bash
clvibe dedupe  # Detect games with identical metadata
```

### Exporting

**Export single game:**
```bash
clvibe export "Game Name"              # Export as zip
clvibe export 1 -o my-game.zip         # Custom filename
```

**Export all games:**
```bash
clvibe batch-export ./exported/        # Export all as zips
clvibe batch-export ./exported/ -u     # Export as directories
```

## 🎯 Game Format

Each game must have a `game.json` file:

```json
{
    "name": "My Awesome Game",
    "author": "YourName",
    "llm": "Claude Sonnet 4",
    "version": "1.0",
    "lang": "python",
    "lang-version": "3.8+",
    "path": "",
    "main": "main.py"
}
```

**Required fields:**
- `name` - Game title
- `lang` - Programming language (lowercase)

**Optional fields:**
- `author` - Creator name
- `llm` - AI model used to generate
- `version` - Game version
- `lang-version` - Required language version
- `path` - Subdirectory containing the main file
- `main` - Main script filename (for explicit specification)

**Main file detection:**
If `main` is not specified, clvibe will automatically look for:
- `main.<ext>` (e.g., `main.py`, `main.lua`)
- `index.<ext>`
- `game.<ext>`
- `start.<ext>`
- Or any file with the correct extension if only one exists

**Pro tip:** Use `clvibe vibify` to create game.json interactively!

---

## 🌐 Creating Collections

A collection is a zip file containing multiple games:

```
my-collection.zip
├── game-1/
│   ├── game.json
│   └── main.py
├── game-2/
│   ├── game.json
│   └── main.js
└── game-3/
    ├── game.json
    └── main.lua
```

**To create a collection:**
```bash
# Export all games as directories
clvibe batch-export ~/my-collection/ -u

# Zip the collection
cd ~/my-collection/
zip -r game-collection.zip *

# Share or install
clvibe install-collection game-collection.zip
```

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions from fellow vibe coders! Here's how you can help:

### The Vibe Coding Philosophy

This project embraces the AI-first development approach:
- ✨ **LLM-Generated PRs Welcome** - If Claude, GPT, or Gemini wrote your code, that's perfect
- 🎨 **Vibes Over Perfection** - Does it work? Does it feel right? Ship it.
- 🤖 **Prompt Engineering > Traditional Coding** - Share your prompts in PR descriptions
- 🎮 **For the Games** - If it helps people play AI-generated games, it's good

### Adding New Language Support

Edit `clvibe.py` and add to the `runtimes` dictionary:

```python
self.runtimes = {
    # ... existing languages ...
    "newlang": {"cmd": "newlang-interpreter", "ext": ".nl"},
}
```

*(Yes, you can totally ask an LLM to do this for you)*

### Creating Games

1. Prompt your favorite LLM to write a CLI game
2. Use `clvibe vibify ./your-game/` to create game.json interactively
3. Test it works with `clvibe install ./your-game/`
4. Share it in the Discord if you want!

**Pro tip:** The best games come from good prompts.

### Issues & Contributing

**Found a bug? Want a feature?**

This is a vibe-coded project. You can:

1. **Ask an LLM to fix it** - Paste the error and ask for a solution
2. **Fork and modify** - Make your own version
3. **Submit a PR** - If you've got a fix, share it back

**We don't maintain a traditional issue tracker.** Fork it, fix it, share your improvements via PRs if you want.

**Remember:** This tool was built by AI in one conversation. You can extend it the same way.

## ⚠️ Security & Safety

**IMPORTANT:** This tool executes code from games you install. Additionally, both this tool and the games it runs are typically AI-generated, which carries specific risks.

### 🤖 AI-Generated Code Risks

**This tool was written by AI (Claude), and games are expected to be AI-generated:**

- 🐛 **Unpredictable bugs** - AI may generate code with subtle errors or edge cases
- 🔓 **Security gaps** - AI doesn't always follow security best practices
- 💥 **Unintended behavior** - AI-generated code may do unexpected things
- 📝 **Documentation gaps** - Features may not work as described
- 🎲 **Variable quality** - Code quality varies greatly between generations

### 🛡️ Mandatory Security Practices

**Strongly recommended approach - Use containerization:**

```bash
# Docker example (recommended)
docker run -it --rm \
  --name clvibe-sandbox \
  -v $(pwd)/clvibe-games:/home/user/.clvibe \
  -v $(pwd)/downloads:/downloads:ro \
  --network none \
  python:3.11-slim bash

# Install clvibe inside container
pip install --user --no-index /path/to/clvibe

# Podman example (alternative)
podman run -it --rm \
  -v ./clvibe-data:/home/user/.clvibe:Z \
  python:3.11 bash
```

**If you choose not to use containerization:**

1. **Create isolated user:**
   ```bash
   sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash clvibe-user
   sudo su - clvibe-user
   ```

2. **Use temporary home directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir /tmp/clvibe-sandbox
   HOME=/tmp/clvibe-sandbox clvibe play game
   ```

3. **Restrict file access:**
   ```bash
   # Run with limited permissions
   sudo -u nobody env HOME=/tmp/clvibe-home clvibe play game
   ```

### 📋 Safety Checklist

Before installing/running any game:

- [ ] Are you running in a container or isolated environment?
- [ ] Have you reviewed the game's source code?
- [ ] Do you trust the source/author?
- [ ] Have you checked for suspicious file operations?
- [ ] Have you backed up important data?
- [ ] Are you using a non-privileged account?
- [ ] Have you limited network access if needed?

### 🚫 Never Do This

- ❌ Run as root/administrator
- ❌ Give games access to your actual home directory without isolation
- ❌ Install games without reviewing code
- ❌ Trust code just because it's AI-generated
- ❌ Run games with access to sensitive data
- ❌ Assume AI-generated code is safe or correct

### ✅ Best Practices

- ✅ Use containers when possible (Docker, Podman, etc.)
- ✅ Use read-only mounts for game sources
- ✅ Disable network access unless required
- ✅ Review all game.json files and main scripts
- ✅ Test games in throwaway environments first
- ✅ Keep clvibe and games in separate, isolated directories
- ✅ Monitor system resources during gameplay
- ✅ Report suspicious behavior in the Discord community
